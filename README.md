# Requirements
vpython

# Fact
Here i have created some sofwares with VPython module. In this repo the scripts are real-time simulations of physical science, A great way to learn coding aligned with physics.

# Explanation
3Star Motion --> A 3D motion of 3 Stars.

Binary star --> A simulation of 2 stars having mutual gravitational pull.

Bouncing ball --> A 3D model of a ball showing momentum, projectile motion, trajectory and a graph.

Constructive interference --> Two sources of electromagnetic radiations form a new wave with an amplitude equal to the sum of their individual amplitudes.

Destructive interference --> A positive displacement of one wave is cancelled exactly by a negative displacement of the other wave resulting in zero amplitude.

Double Pendula --> A pendulum with another pendulum attached to its end, and exhibits rich dynamic behavior with a strong sensitivity to initial conditions.

Gyroscope --> A device containing a rapidly spinning wheel or circulating beam of light that is used to detect the deviation of an object from its desired orientation.

Hard Sphere --> It is defined simply as impenetrable spheres that cannot overlap in space.

Krel --> Kinetic energy relative to center of mass of a moving object.

Lens --> Interactive ray tracing through a converging or a diverging lens.

Newton grid --> A single force illustrating the Momentum Principle, Newton's 2nd law.

Quantum oscillator --> When displaced from its equilibrium position, experiences a restoring force F proportional to the displacement x, where k is a positive const.

Sinusoidal wave --> A sine wave or sinusoidal wave is a mathematical curve that describes a smooth periodic oscillation.

Space station --> Motion in the noninertial frame of a rotating space station.

Spectrum --> A diffraction grating display of emission spectra and dark-line absorption spectra.

Ball and spring model of solid --> if you try to pull molecules in a solid apart they attract each other and if you try to push molecules in a solid together, they repel each other.

Variables and Loops --> A program to teach the basics of Python variables and loops.
